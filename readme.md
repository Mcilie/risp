# Risp

Rust + Lisp = Risp

Goals/Questions? (some of these are contradictory): 
- compiled
- Maybe compile to specific compute backends, or just LLVM and say fuck it
- first class support for Multi-threading, Web, ML
- good (non turing complete) typing system (static?).
- schizo-level research to have great guarantees 
- Niche stdlib (see first class support, also good support for parseing)
